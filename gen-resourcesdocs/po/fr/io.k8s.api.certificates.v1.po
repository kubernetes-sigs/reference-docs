#: CertificateSigningRequest
msgid "CertificateSigningRequest objects provide a mechanism to obtain x509 certificates by submitting a certificate signing request, and having it asynchronously approved and issued.Kubelets use this API to obtain: 1. client certificates to authenticate to kube-apiserver (with the \"kubernetes.io/kube-apiserver-client-kubelet\" signerName). 2. serving certificates for TLS endpoints kube-apiserver can connect to securely (with the \"kubernetes.io/kubelet-serving\" signerName).This API can be used to request client certificates to authenticate to kube-apiserver (with the \"kubernetes.io/kube-apiserver-client\" signerName), or to obtain certificates from custom non-Kubernetes signers."

msgid "APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object. Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and may reject unrecognized values. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#resources"

Requests for this signer are never auto-approved by kube-controller-manager, can be issued by the \"csrsigning\" controller in kube-controller-manager. 2. \"kubernetes.io/kube-apiserver-client-kubelet\": issues client certificates that kubelets use to authenticate to kube-apiserver.  Requests for this signer can be auto-approved by the \"csrapproving\" controller in kube-controller-manager, and can be issued by the \"csrsigning\" controller in kube-controller-manager. 3. \"kubernetes.io/kubelet-serving\" issues serving certificates that kubelets use to serve TLS endpoints, which kube-apiserver can connect to securely.  Requests for this signer are never auto-approved by kube-controller-manager, and can be issued by the \"csrsigning\" controller in kube-controller-manager.More details are available at https://k8s.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/certificate-signing-requests/#kubernetes-signersCustom signerNames can also be specified. The signer defines: 1. Trust distribution: how trust (CA bundles) are distributed. 2. Permitted subjects: and behavior when a disallowed subject is requested. 3. Required, permitted, or forbidden x509 extensions in the request (including whether subjectAltNames are allowed, which types, restrictions on allowed values) and behavior when a disallowed extension is requested. 4. Required, permitted, or forbidden key usages / extended key usages. 5. Expiration/certificate lifetime: whether it is fixed by the signer, configurable by the admin. 6. Whether or not requests for CA certificates are allowed."

All PEM blocks must have the \"CERTIFICATE\" label, contain no headers, and the encoded data  must be a BER-encoded ASN.1 Certificate structure as described in section 4 of RFC5280. 3. Non-PEM content may appear before or after the \"CERTIFICATE\" PEM blocks and is unvalidated,  to allow for explanatory text as described in section 5.2 of RFC7468.If more than one PEM block is present, and the definition of the requested spec.signerName does not indicate otherwise, the first block is the issued certificate, and subsequent blocks should be treated as intermediate certificates and presented in TLS handshakes.The certificate is encoded in PEM format.When serialized as JSON or YAML, the data is additionally base64-encoded, so it consists of:    base64(    -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----    ...    -----END CERTIFICATE-----    )"
