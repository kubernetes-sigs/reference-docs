#: HTTPIngressPath
msgid "HTTPIngressPath associates a path with a backend. Incoming urls matching the path are forwarded to the backend."
msgstr ""

#: HTTPIngressPath.backend
msgid "Backend defines the referenced service endpoint to which the traffic will be forwarded to."
msgstr ""

#: HTTPIngressPath.path
msgid "Path is matched against the path of an incoming request. Currently it can contain characters disallowed from the conventional \"path\" part of a URL as defined by RFC 3986. Paths must begin with a '/'. When unspecified, all paths from incoming requests are matched."
msgstr ""

#: HTTPIngressPath.pathType
msgid ""
"PathType determines the interpretation of the Path matching. PathType can be one of the following values: * Exact: Matches the URL path exactly. * Prefix: Matches based on a URL path prefix split by '/'. Matching is"
"  done on a path element by element basis. A path element refers is the"
"  list of labels in the path split by the '/' separator. A request is a"
"  match for path p if every p is an element-wise prefix of p of the"
"  request path. Note that if the last element of the path is a substring"
"  of the last element in request path, it is not a match (e.g. /foo/bar"
"  matches /foo/bar/baz, but does not match /foo/barbaz)."
"* ImplementationSpecific: Interpretation of the Path matching is up to"
"  the IngressClass. Implementations can treat this as a separate PathType"
"  or treat it identically to Prefix or Exact path types."
"Implementations are required to support all path types. Defaults to ImplementationSpecific."

#: HTTPIngressRuleValue
msgid "HTTPIngressRuleValue is a list of http selectors pointing to backends. In the example: http://<host>/<path>?<searchpart> -> backend where where parts of the url correspond to RFC 3986, this resource will be used to match against everything after the last '/' and before the first '?' or '#'."
msgstr ""

#: HTTPIngressRuleValue.paths
msgid "A collection of paths that map requests to backends."
msgstr ""

#: Ingress
msgid "Ingress is a collection of rules that allow inbound connections to reach the endpoints defined by a backend. An Ingress can be configured to give services externally-reachable urls, load balance traffic, terminate SSL, offer name based virtual hosting etc. DEPRECATED - This group version of Ingress is deprecated by networking.k8s.io/v1beta1 Ingress. See the release notes for more information."

#: Ingress.apiVersion
msgid "APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object. Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and may reject unrecognized values. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#resources"

#: Ingress.kind
msgid "Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents. Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits requests to. Cannot be updated. In CamelCase. More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds"

#: IngressRule
msgid "IngressRule represents the rules mapping the paths under a specified host to the related backend services. Incoming requests are first evaluated for a host match, then routed to the backend associated with the matching IngressRuleValue."
msgstr ""

#: IngressRule.host
msgid ""
"Host is the fully qualified domain name of a network host, as defined by RFC 3986. Note the following deviations from the \"host\" part of the URI as defined in RFC 3986: 1. IPs are not allowed. Currently an IngressRuleValue can only apply to"
"   the IP in the Spec of the parent Ingress."
"2. The `:` delimiter is not respected because ports are not allowed."
"	  Currently the port of an Ingress is implicitly :80 for http and"
"	  :443 for https."
"Both these may change in the future. Incoming requests are matched against the host before the IngressRuleValue. If the host is unspecified, the Ingress routes all traffic based on the specified IngressRuleValue."
""
"Host can be \"precise\" which is a domain name without the terminating dot of a network host (e.g. \"foo.bar.com\") or \"wildcard\", which is a domain name prefixed with a single wildcard label (e.g. \"*.foo.com\"). The wildcard character '*' must appear by itself as the first DNS label and matches only a single label. You cannot have a wildcard label by itself (e.g. Host == \"*\"). Requests will be matched against the Host field in the following way: 1. If Host is precise, the request matches this rule if the http host header is equal to Host. 2. If Host is a wildcard, then the request matches this rule if the http host header is to equal to the suffix (removing the first label) of the wildcard rule."

#: IngressSpec
msgid "IngressSpec describes the Ingress the user wishes to exist."
msgstr ""

#: IngressSpec.backend
msgid "A default backend capable of servicing requests that don't match any rule. At least one of 'backend' or 'rules' must be specified. This field is optional to allow the loadbalancer controller or defaulting logic to specify a global default."
msgstr ""

#: IngressSpec.ingressClassName
msgid "IngressClassName is the name of the IngressClass cluster resource. The associated IngressClass defines which controller will implement the resource. This replaces the deprecated `kubernetes.io/ingress.class` annotation. For backwards compatibility, when that annotation is set, it must be given precedence over this field. The controller may emit a warning if the field and annotation have different values. Implementations of this API should ignore Ingresses without a class specified. An IngressClass resource may be marked as default, which can be used to set a default value for this field. For more information, refer to the IngressClass documentation."

#: IngressSpec.rules
msgid "A list of host rules used to configure the Ingress. If unspecified, or no rule matches, all traffic is sent to the default backend."
msgstr ""

#: IngressSpec.tls
msgid "TLS configuration. Currently the Ingress only supports a single TLS port, 443. If multiple members of this list specify different hosts, they will be multiplexed on the same port according to the hostname specified through the SNI TLS extension, if the ingress controller fulfilling the ingress supports SNI."

msgstr ""

#: IngressTLS.secretName
msgid "SecretName is the name of the secret used to terminate SSL traffic on 443. Field is left optional to allow SSL routing based on SNI hostname alone. If the SNI host in a listener conflicts with the \"Host\" header field used by an IngressRule, the SNI host is used for termination and value of the Host header is used for routing."
